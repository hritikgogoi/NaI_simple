# NaI Geant4 Simulation  
A Geant4-based simulation of a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. This repository includes Monte Carlo simulations for NaI detectors, commonly used in nuclear and particle physics experiments.

This is the basic B1 example, modified for NaI(Tl). All necessary files are available inside the B1 folder. Please refer to the README file inside the folder for more detail.
